# Delta Indicator for ProRealTime

## Overview
This indicator calculates a delta value for use in options trading, particularly for selling options. The delta is derived based on the VIX, the current price of the US500 (or any asset), and the 45-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the assetâ€™s price. The calculated delta is constrained between 0.12 and 0.25, making it suitable for setting strike prices for selling options.

## Formula
The delta is calculated using the following formula:

```
delta = max(0.12, min(0.25, (VIX / 100) + ((Current Price - 45-day SMA) / 45-day SMA) + ((VIX / 100) * sqrt(30 / 365) / 2)))
```

Where:
- `VIX` is the current volatility index (represented as a percentage).
- `Current Price` is the current price of the underlying asset (e.g., US500).
- `45-day SMA` is the 45-day Simple Moving Average of the asset price.
- The result is clamped between 0.12 and 0.25.

## How to Use in ProRealTime

1. **Accessing VIX:**
   - Ensure that VIX is accessible on the same chart as the asset you're analyzing (e.g., US500).
   - If VIX is a part of the chart (for example, if VIX is represented in a secondary panel), ensure it can be accessed by referencing its data series.

2. **Installation:**
   - Open ProRealTime.
   - Go to the **Indicators** tab.
   - Select **Create Indicator** or **New Indicator**.
   - Copy and paste the code provided below into the code editor.
   - Adjust the VIX reference if necessary (see below).

3. **Code:**
   Here's the full ProRealCode to calculate the delta:

   ```prorealcode
   // Define the variables
   VIX = VIX[0] // Ensure this is the correct method to access the VIX value
   currentPrice = close // Current price of the asset (e.g., US500)
   movingAvg = average[45](close) // 45-period Simple Moving Average
   
   // Formula calculation
   deltaFormula = (VIX / 100) + ((currentPrice - movingAvg) / movingAvg) + ((VIX / 100) * sqrt(30 / 365) / 2)
   
   // Clamp the delta between 0.12 and 0.25
   delta = max(0.12, min(0.25, deltaFormula))
   
   // Plot the delta
   return delta
   ```

4. **Customization:**
   - Replace `VIX[0]` with the correct method of accessing VIX data if VIX is already displayed on your chart. For example, if VIX is provided as a built-in indicator, use that reference.
   - Apply the indicator to the chart for the US500 or any other asset you wish to analyze.

5. **Plotting:**
   The indicator will plot a value on the chart representing the delta to sell options. The delta value will always be between 0.12 and 0.25.

## Important Notes
- The delta formula assumes a 30-day expiration period for the options.
- Ensure that VIX is available on the same chart and properly referenced for the calculation to work correctly.
- The currentPrice and movingAvg are based on the asset displayed in the chart (e.g., US500), so this indicator can be adapted to any underlying asset.
  
## Example Use Case
This indicator is primarily useful for option sellers looking to determine a delta level to set strike prices when selling options. For example, you might use this to select a strike price with a 0.25 delta, which represents the probability of the option expiring in-the-money.

This guide should help you configure and use the delta indicator in ProRealTime. Make sure to adjust the `VIX` reference to match how the platform handles VIX data for your specific chart.
